# Surf Break MERN Stack App

# Description
This Mern Stack Surf Forecast application is for users to see general weather information along with  current tide, wind, and swell conditions about various surf spots worth checking out. Users can review spots to fill in any information about the beach not provided in the database, and can also like their surf sessions, allowing them to go back and remember past surfs.

# Getting Started

# Project Issues 

Finding good API documentation that provided the data that is necessary for this project.   

## Future Enhancements
For future modifications, I would like to add a review sheet for each location, along with a favorites button so that users can easily locate their preferred surf spots. In addition, I would like to eventually be able to add a winter sports directory where it would list numerous places for users to check out during the winter time.
